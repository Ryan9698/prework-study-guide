# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

    This prework study guide was designed as a means to quickly access key information in regards to the following topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It is to be used as a quick reference guide and highlights several useful items as well as some useful knowledge to apply while working on projects. It was built as a means to practice my development skills while also supplying useful information that I can refer to at any time. Not only does it provide information but it also provides the user a starting point via the console. Through this experience, I learned fundamental coding basics as well as useful shortcuts and industry standards for formatting.

## Usage

This study guide focuses mainly on basic coding functions and rules for the user who is freshly starting their journey into programming and web design. It is not an all-in-one resource but it does provide information that I believe to be relevant and useful for a beginner such as myself. I also highlighted some key points in regards to formatting in a professional environment. There are notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If the DevTools console is opened, a user can see a list of topics as well as a suggestion for where to begin.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
